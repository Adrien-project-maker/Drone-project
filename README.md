# Drone-project
Hi, i'm new to Github and I'm currently learning how to use it.
This project have for main objective to make a handmade drone flying
and being able to be controll with a controller.
Warning! This code isn't finish and I withdraw from all form of responsibility in the event
of malfunction, breakage, or injury.
Use this code carefully, as part of your own experiments.
For now, I have work alone on this project, and I've learn everything by
my own or by searching how things work. Thanks for being intrested in my work!

Edit : I'm writing this .readme in english to allow much users as possible to being able to read it,
but be aware that most of my code is in french, including the notes. Maybe i'll try later to make all of them understandable 
in english, but for now, it's not my main objective.
