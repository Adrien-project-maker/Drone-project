This project have for main objective to make a handmade drone flying
and being able to be controll with a controller.
Waring! This code isn't finish and I withdraw from all form ofresponsibility in the event
of malfunction, breakage, or injury.
Use this code carefully, as part of your own experiments.
For now, I have work alone on this project, and I've learn everything by
my own or by searching how things work. Thanks for being intrested in my work!
